# OSiRIS
## On-Site water Reuse Instant-Simulator
### Simulate and evaluate the effect of on-site water reuse interventions on energy use and water and pollutant flows in a household, building, or community!

## Simulation model features:
- High temporal resolution, enabled by diurnal water usage patterns\

- Rapid simulation of C++ based model: < 1 min for 10 years @ 15 min resolution (depends on hardware platform)
- High flexibility
  - From centralized to extremely decentralized: direct use of city water, selection of installed tanks and treatments

  - Scalable from single household to district level (e.g. weighted rain correction factor for roads vs. roofs, increased pump energy for greater distances,â€¦)
- Water and pollutant balance: incoming precipitation, storage tanks, usage in household, and infiltration, sewer, or collection by truck
- Simplified treatment for water reuse simulation based on treatment "specsheet": recovery, energy use, design flow, rejection (membranes), degradation\

- Renewable energy simulation for water pumping + treatments\

  - Energy use is prioritized between demanding treatments
  - Battery can be used in conjunction with solar panels
  - Grid electricity is used as back-up
  - Built-in solar insolation, cloud, and photovoltaic models if data is unavailable
- Simulation of garden irrigation based on solar irradiance and precipitation

## Standalone app with user interface
- Scenario framework: Create different settings combinations or load from a file, simulate in bulk, and save settings, scheme, KPI, and data to files\

- Dynamic scheme (see above) automatically adapts to user settings
- High modifiability, easily change up to 112 model variables, for example:
  - Which water quality to reuse and for which applications
  - Which tanks and treatments to install (including volumes, specifications,...)
  - What to do with excess wastewater
- Built-in key performance indicators (KPI) for scenario analysis:
  - Water independence on import, water independence on export, circularity, local water recharge, drought tolerance, energy independence
  - Display KPI in graph (line or spider), choose which KPIs and which scenarios to display\

- Evaluate simulation results in graphs for the volume and concentration of tanks, renewable and grid energy use, and battery capacity
